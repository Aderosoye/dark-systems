  <h1>PowerShell is My Keyboard</h1>
  <div class="meta">Posted: June 2025 | Tags: #Automation #PowerShell #Scripting</div>

  <p>To most people, PowerShell is just another tool. To me, it’s my primary interface with the machine. It's my second keyboard — wired not to type words, but to launch systems.</p>

  <p>I don’t write scripts for fun. I write them to free myself from repetition. If I do something twice, I script it. If it has a pattern, I automate it. If it can fail, I design it to self-heal.</p>

  <p>Here’s what that looks like in real life:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>💻 Deploying Azure environments with a single line</li>
    <li>🔁 Spinning up dev boxes with roles, permissions, and backups pre-wired</li>
    <li>📦 Packaging scripts as products for other engineers</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Every automation I create is a quiet multiplier. The system runs, I focus on bigger missions. This is how I build Dark👣 Systems.</p>

  <p>If you want to see how deep it goes, grab the toolkit I built for elite IT pros:</p>

  <p>I don’t build noise. I build leverage. And PowerShell is the lever.</p>
