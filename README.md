# Dark👣 Systems
**Tools. Scripts. Power.**

This is the personal platform of **Ayobamidele Aderosoye** — systems engineer, infrastructure architect, and founder of the Dark👣 Tech Empire. I build automation tools, deploy cloud infrastructure, and document the process quietly and powerfully.

> In 2025, I stumbled across the world of systems administration while studying networking fundamentals — and instantly recognized it as the missing link.
>
> With a background in telecoms and a natural pull toward infrastructure, I’ve since immersed myself in automation, scripting, and cloud operations — delivering real-world M365 migrations, packaging tools, and shipping polished projects publicly.
>
> My approach isn’t academic — it’s action-first. Everything I build reflects real environments, real constraints, and production-level thinking.
>
> I’m not chasing titles. I’m building systems.
